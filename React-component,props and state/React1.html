    <div class="question">
        <h2>What is React Js?</h2>
        <p>React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the UI in response to changes in data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>What is NPM in React Js?</h2>
        <p>NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a package manager for JavaScript and the default package manager for Node.js. In React.js development, NPM is used to install and manage dependencies, including React itself and other third-party libraries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>What is Role of Node Js in React Js?</h2>
        <p>Node.js is used in React.js development for several purposes, including running a development server, managing dependencies with NPM, and executing build scripts. It provides a runtime environment for JavaScript outside the browser, allowing developers to build full-stack applications with JavaScript.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>What is CLI command In React Js?</h2>
        <p>In React.js, CLI (Command Line Interface) commands are used to perform various tasks such as creating a new React project, running the development server, building the production-ready code, and deploying the application. The most commonly used CLI command is <code>npx create-react-app</code> to create a new React project.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>What is Components in React Js?</h2>
        <p>In React.js, a component is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates a part of the user interface. Components can be simple, representing a single UI element, or complex, composed of multiple smaller components. They promote reusability, maintainability, and modularity in React.js applications.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>What is Header and Content Components in React Js?</h2>
        <p>In a React.js application, the Header and Content components are commonly used to structure the layout of the user interface. The Header component typically contains the navigation menu, branding, and other top-level elements, while the Content component renders the main content of the page. These components help organize the UI into smaller, manageable parts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>How to install React Js on Windows, Linux Operating System? How to install NPM and How to check version of NPM?</h2>
        <p>To install React.js on Windows or Linux operating systems, you can use Node Package Manager (NPM). First, install Node.js, which includes NPM, from the official website (https://nodejs.org/). Once Node.js is installed, you can create a new React project using the <code>npx create-react-app</code> command. To check the version of NPM installed on your system, run <code>npm -v</code> in the command line.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>How to check version of React Js?</h2>
        <p>To check the version of React.js installed in your project, navigate to your project directory in the command line and run <code>npm list react</code>. This command will display the version of React.js installed in your project's dependencies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>How to change in components of React Js?</h2>
        <p>In React.js, components can be changed by modifying their state or props. State represents the internal data of a component that can change over time, while props are immutable data passed from parent to child components. To update the state of a component, you can use the <code>setState()</code> method. To update props, you need to pass new values from the parent component.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>How to Create a List View in React Js?</h2>
        <p>In React.js, you can create a list view by mapping over an array of data and rendering individual list items as components. For example, you can use the <code>map()</code> method to iterate over an array of items and return a list of <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements. Each <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element can contain data from the array, such as text or images.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>Create Increment decrement state change by button click?</h2>
        <p>To create an increment/decrement state change in React.js, you can define a state variable to hold the current count value. Then, you can define two functions, one for incrementing the count and another for decrementing it. These functions will update the state using the <code>setState()</code> method. Finally, you can render buttons that call these functions when clicked.</p>
